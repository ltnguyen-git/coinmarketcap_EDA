# Coinmarketcap_EDA

A Streamlit App that is used to display cryptocurrency prices from coinmarketcap is contained in the first file, "Coinmarketcap EDA.py." In order to crawl data from https://coinmarketcap.com, the code first imports a number of libraries, including Streamlit, Pandas, Matplotlib, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium. It then displays a barplot of the percentage price change over the course of seven days, twenty-four hours, or one hour.

Using Selenium and BeautifulSoup, I test crawling data from a website in "Crawl coin marketcap.ipynb."

Regarding the website "Crawl coinmarketcap api.ipynb," where I use an API key to crawl data
